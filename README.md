# Textart
This is a small python GUI program that can convert an image into (ASCII) text art. Current features of the program include different palettes of text characters to render the text art with, and the ability to specify character width and height constraints on the image to render just the right size.

## Requirements
- This program requires the [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) library to be installed, which can be done with the following command:  

  ```
  pip install Pillow
  ```

- Tkinter
- Python 3.8 and above
## Usage
The program can be launched from the commandline by calling python on the textart package. Doing so will bring up the GUI.  

```
python textart
```
